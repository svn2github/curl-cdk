    CDK Data Services Overview
}
{paragraph
    With Curl Data Kit library Data Services (CDK-DS) packages,
    you can use remoting and messaging to interact with
    servers supporting the AMF data transfer protocol.
}
{summary

    The CDK-DS implements all the remoting and web messaging services
    that are supported by the open source BlazeDS server,
    including remote procedure calls (RPC) and publish/subscribe messaging.

        {item {bold Remoting}
            
            The {docref COM.CURL.CDK.RPC} package
            provides a {docref RemoteObject} adapter
            for invocation of remote methods.

            This allows Curl applications to invoke
            remote methods available from AMF service providers.
        }

||--        {item {link href = {url "cdk-ds-messaging.curl"}, {bold Messaging}}
        {item {bold Messaging}
            
            The {docref COM.CURL.CDK.MESSAGING} package
            provides a {docref Producer} and {docref Consumer} adapters
            for exchange of messages with AMF service providers.

            This allows Curl applications to participate in
            Publish / Subscribe message exchange.
        }

||--        {item  {link href = {url "cdk-ds-data-object.curl"}, {bold Data Object}}
        {item  {bold Data Object}
            
            The {docref COM.CURL.CDK.DATA-OBJECT} package
            provides a flexible representation for data records.

            This allows data centric Curl applications to
            work in a uniform way with data obtained from data services.

    AMF Protocol 
}

{paragraph
    Action Message Format (AMF) is a compact binary data transfer format used
    originally for serializing ActionScript object graphs.

    The AMF protocol specification is open source, described by these documents:
    {itemize
        {item
            {link href = {url "http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/amf/amf3_spec_121207.pdf"},

            AMF 0 Specification}
        }}

    It is now supported on a wide range of server platforms, including

    The sample applications referenced in this developers guide
    work with testdrive services provided with
    {link href = {url "http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/blazeds/Release+Builds"},
    BlazeDS Turnkey distribution} version {monospace 3.2.0978}.

    These examples are supplied as an archive file (.zip) in
    {link href = samples-zip-loc, {value samples-zip-loc.filename}}

    See {link href = samples-readme-loc, {value samples-readme-loc.filename}}
    for information of setting up BlazeDS Turnkey installation with these Curl samples.

    Note that samples that access service use localhost as the hostname, and 8400 as the port.
    || TODO: checking

    Source code for the samples is collected in a Curl project,
    that can be loaded into the IDE:  
    {link href = {curl-edit-url samples-project-loc}, {value samples-project-loc.filename}}
 
    || TODO: Note that files under this directory can be deleted or modified when you reinstall or upgrade Curl.
