    {parameter endpoint,
        The {docref Url} of the server that this {docref RemoteObject} is going to
        communicate with.  Also if no {docref channel-set} is provided, this will
        be used to make a {docref ChannelSet} wrapped around a {docref AMFChannel}.

        The destination at the {param endpoint} for all messages being sent.

        {docref EventHandler}s to receive events on this object.

    {notes
        The {docref EventHandler}s on this object can receive
        {docref ResultEvent}s, {docref InvokeEvent}s, and {docref FaultEvent}s
        for all messages sent and received through this object.  If events
        for just a single request are desired, add the {docref EventHandler}

        {docref AbstractServive.get-operation} on this object.
